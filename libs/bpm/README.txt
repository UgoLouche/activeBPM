The Bayes Point Machine Toolbox requires the Lightspeed toolbox, available from
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/

See Contents.m for a list of functions.  This toolbox uses the
object-oriented features of Matlab.  You first create a 'task'
structure, then create a 'bpm_ep' object.  This object has methods
like 'train' and 'classify'.  See the 'test' scripts for examples.
